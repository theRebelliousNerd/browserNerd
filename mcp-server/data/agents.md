Scratch area for persisted artifacts referenced by the BrowserNERD MCP server.

- Used for session stores or captured fact snapshots when experimenting with the detached server model.
- Keep contents small, sanitized, and reproducible; avoid committing secrets, credentials, or personally identifiable data.
- Align any persisted samples with the schemas and scenarios described in `../docs/PRD.md`.
